ESP8266-01 IoT SMART TIMER FOR HOME AUTOMATION by Eric Brouwer

This code run on ESP8266.
You can find all the info on the project in the original post of the autor Eric Brower here: 
https://www.instructables.com/id/ESP8266-01-IoT-Smart-Timer-for-Home-Automation/

This github only exist for the porpuse to share my little improvement to let the code works with 
this PCB easy available on eBay: https://www.ebay.it/itm/ESP8266-5V-Wifi-Relay-Module-TOI-APP-Controled-For-Smart-Home-ESP-01S/122699105554?hash=item1c916fc512:g:dTcAAOSwq2pbLfhe

In this repository you can find schematics of this relay board and a Telegram python bot to control the SmartTimer over the Internet.

Obviously you need some little server (also a raspberry) running the python code for the telegram bot: 
it has to be in the same LAN of the IoT smart timer.

Here you can find some instruction to setup a bot from scratch: https://www.hackster.io/Salmanfarisvp/telegram-bot-with-raspberry-pi-f373da

Thanks again to Eric Brouwer and Salman Faris.
